Hi! I am Parth Dodhia, a senior undergrad majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at [IIT Bombay](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/).
I'm working with Prof. [Vivek Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/borkar) on Stochastic Approximation algorithms for Reinforcement Learning for my bachelor's thesis.
